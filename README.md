# **Mirroring Registries The Easy Way**

<img src="mirror.jpg" style="width: 1000px;" border=0/>

OpenShift makes it easy to manage Kubernetes clusters that have unfettered internet access using well-known registries. However, preparation for deployment and maintenance of clusters reliant on locally hosted mirror registries can be challenging. The process of mirroring the registry content can be cumbersome with multiple steps, time consuming and sometimes down right frustrating.  However with the promise of the oc-mirror tool which was released as technical preview in OpenShift 4.10 a new dawn seamed on the horizon for mirroring activites. Now with the release of OpenShift 4.11 the oc-mirror tools has official gone GA and with adds additional feature functionality. 

## Use Cases We Are Addressing

* Minimizing the amount of content downloaded
* Simplifying the mirroring process
* Ensuring the right content is mirrored
* Better overall user experience with a single command to manage images

## New Features Included In GA

* Prune OpenShift and Operator images
* Select image content based on version range selections
* OSUS graph creation
* Option to prefer direct update paths and skip intermediate releases

## Existing Features from 4.10 Technical Preview

 * Provides a centralized method to mirror OpenShift Container Platform releases, Operators, helm charts, and other images.
 * Maintains update paths for OpenShift Container Platform and Operators.
 * Uses a declarative image set configuration file to include only the OpenShift Container Platform releases, Operators, and images required by cluster

As I mentioned before oc-mirror was released as technical preview in OpenShift 4.10 and there is a preview blog which covers the basic features and usage of the tool [here](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/how-oc-mirror-will-help-you-reduce-container-management-complexity).  With that stated this blog will focus on the new features to the 4.11 GA release that we highlighted above.
